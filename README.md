_Add your answers to this `README` file._

* What do you notice now that `normalize.css` is being used? Add your answer to this `README` file.

* Why is `normalize.css` useful? 
  * The normalize.css is a simple way to let the webpage look more or less the same in different browsers. This 'preset' is a fast way to have a preview of the page, without coding an own css-file. Additional the user can later specify some code in his own css-file / or use 'style' in the html-code (after the link to the normalize.css).


* What is the difference between normalize and css resets? 
  * While 'normalize' is a fast preview-tool, reset will 'reset' all elements to 0 / null / hidden (bullseye) .. you don't see a different font-size between 'h1' and 'p' nor 'sub', no typographic paragraph format and so on. The Reset is usefull to 'kill' every browser-default-preset and use only your own code. Every change you see is only a part of YOUR written code.
